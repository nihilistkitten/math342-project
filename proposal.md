% 342 Proposal: The Fundamental Groupoid

*Topic*: The fundamental groupoid of a topological space.

*Summary*: My main goals would be to

(1) motivate and define the fundamental groupoid, and
(2) see how far I can extend this to higher homotopy group(oid)s and
$\infty$-categories.

I skimmed this section in Bradley and I think there's a nice picture here. If we
fix a basepoint and consider just loops at that basepoint, we get a single point
and a number of arrows, each of which can be traversed in either direction. The
"single point and a number of arrows", if you just think about the
objects-and-arrows picture of a category, sounds exactly like a monoid. The fact
that each arrow can be traversed in either direction tells you that each
morphism is an isomorphism, i.e. that the monoid is a group. In a sense thinking
of groups categorically lines up exactly with the geometric intuition we have
rely on for topological spaces; this line of throught made it much clearer to me
why we should expect the fundamental group to be a group and not some other
algebraic structure. That approach also motivates asking what happens when you
relax the requirement of a fixed basepoint.
